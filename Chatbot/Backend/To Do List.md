# TO DO LIST
#### 1. Handle cases where the user specifies ***more than one city*** or ***more than one state*** to search in.[to the database consider addding a column which stores the State name as well]
#### 2. Handle cases where if the category isnt found in one city, ***search in the nearest 5 cities*** or create a chip response type asking which neighbouring city the person wants to search in and return results of that city.
#### 3. Add a ***clickable link to the website*** for each ngo in their dropdown descriptions.
#### 4. Improve that ***database structure***. Actually generate the complete database.
#### 5. See if there is an API that will allow you to find the state in which a city belongs. If there is then use it to make the database searches more efficient for city+category type and also state+city+Category type.

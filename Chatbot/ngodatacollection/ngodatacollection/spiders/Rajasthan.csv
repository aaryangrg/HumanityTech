This Is To Ensure Development Of Their Potentials, Sustainable Working Conditions and A Harmonious Living With Dignity & Peace. Around 70% Of Indian Population Is Dependent On Agriculture In One Way Or Other, Most Of These People Suffer On Account Of Non Availability Of Continuous Employment and Proper Returns. To Solve This Gigantic Problem The Immediate Need Of The Time Is To ?Diversify The Manpower From Agriculture To Other Sectors Of Working and Employment and Preparing The People By Education, Motivation, Information and Skills To Change Over To New Avenues. The Other Important Aspect To Be Taken Immediate Attention At Priority Basis Is The Growing Desertification Receding Water Level Leading To Scarcity, Depleting Forest, Degradation Of Environment."
